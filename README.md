# Webpack Demo

- [Webpack Getting Started Guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)
- [FreeCodeCamp Webpack + React Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-up-deploy-your-react-app-from-scratch-using-webpack-and-babel-a669891033d4/)
- **Objectives**: 
	- Review and refresh on working specifically with webpack 5.
	- Set up a frontend project by using webpack 5 instead of default scaffolding
	- Along with refreshing on webpack, review using react

## Notes
- it's important to use common js syntax in the `webpack.config.js` as it's not a module and doesn't recognize esm syntax (this would require an experimental flag and I believe the use of babel or some other transpiler)

### Issues
